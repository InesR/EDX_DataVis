The majority of students enrolled in Data Visualization for All have attended more than 12 years of school, which probably means they have at least concluded secondary education. The most common number of years of schooling (mode) is 21, and the second most common is 16.


Nations with the highest percentage of female students enrolled in Data Visualization for All are the Ukraine (51 percent) and Turkey (47 percent), based on preliminary data for those with high enrollment levels (25 or more students).

I used the definitions of education levels set by OECD (see https://data.oecd.org/eduatt/adult-education-level.htm)
